ETL is a type of data integration that refers to the three steps (extract, transform, load) used to blend data from multiple sources. 
It's often used to build a data warehouse. During this process, data is taken (extracted) from a source system, converted (transformed) into a format that can be analyzed, and stored (loaded) into a data warehouse or other system.
 Extract, load, transform (ELT) is an alternate but related approach designed to push processing down to the database for improved performance.
